# Employee-Data-Analysis

# Overview
Identifying Data Relationships with PostgreSQL. This challenge was to determine the number of retiring employees per title and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program to help future-proof a company as current employees reach retirement age.

# Results

Looking at the summary data tables constructed:
- 1,549 employees were shown to be eligible for the mentorship program
- Senior Engineers were the largest group for the Retiring Titles
- Managers were surprisingly the smallest group for the Retiring Titles
- Several employees have been with the company long enough to change titles multiple times

# Summary
- As the "silver tsunami" mentorship program prepares to make an impact, management should prepare for 1,549 employees to begin retiring.

- There are plenty of qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of the company's employees. The only category that is quite low is the manager category but that is expected as there are fewer departments.
